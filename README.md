## What is LivingPlants? ##

Do you get tired of the desolate feeling of a biome where all of it's natural vegetation has been removed? What if plants slowly grew back into the world? Living plants is a Bukkit plugin for Minecraft that will periodically grow plants in loaded chunks.

For more information check out our [Bukkit Dev page](TODO).

## How Fast Do Plants Grow? ##

Currently, plants are balanced so that all the flora of a biome will respawn to natural levels with 8 hours of play time. The plugin comes with a configuration file that let's the server owner determine the rate at which they want plants to grow.
